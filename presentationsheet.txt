Intro
	The british air force
	Worlds oldest independent air force (independent from army or navy control)
	Founded in 1918 in the end of WW1 (biggest air force then)
	next year anniversary (April 1st)
	They invented strategic bombing (terror bombing so the population of a country is willing to surrender)

battle of britain
	The luftwaffe was far superior to the RAF in the beginning
	before the war even started visitors in germany were told about how unbeatable and gigantic the luftwaffe was
	however a big part of the british air force was outdated, transportes or sea rescue planes
	Hitler was a fan of the architecture and culture in britain and therefor wanted them to surrender
	as that did not work out hitler wanted to fully oppress the RAF and take britain without destroying it
	resulted in huge losses
	only after those disasters they started bombing military building and eventually also started strategic bombing
	Hitlers struggling and 	ignorance might have lost the reich the win over britain
	churchill trusted in air crafts to defend his country as no invasion could take place without the luftwaffe having control in the air
